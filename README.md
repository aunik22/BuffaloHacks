# Health Insurance Predictor
A model that predicts the total amount an individual should pay per year for health insurance. If a user wants to buy a health insurance for the first time, then the website associated to the model will give them a prediction based on their attributes how much they should pay for their package per year. This will allow the user to make smarter decisions about choosing a new health insurance plan. If the user already has a health insurance, after entering their attributes, they will get feedback saying whether or not they are getting the best deal for them. This will allow the user to not overpay for something they don't need. The current model has an accuracy of 96%
